To create the best dashboards to communicate your analysis, it is important to understand the specific needs and objectives of stakeholders. In this Project, I will dive into the phases of data analysis including:
1. ASK
2. PREPARE
3. PROCESS
4. ANALYZE
5. SHARE

<ins>1. ASK</ins>

This phase of the analysis includes asking the right questions to answer the goals and objectives of your stakeholders.
In this dataset we get to answer the follwing questions concerning *key performance indicators(KPI)*:

1. What is the percentage of people who purchased a bike?
2. Is there a correlation between income levels,age, and commute distance and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
3. What types of occupations are more likely to result in bike purchases?
4. Is there a correlation between age, education levels, and bike purchases?

**2. PREPARE**

Preparing phase includes identifying the data that is required to answer the stakeholder questions. In this case we have the *"Bike Purchase"* dataset to work with. 

**3. PROCESS**
